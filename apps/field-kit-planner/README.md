# field-kit-planner

A tiny, static (GitHub Pages–friendly) field/trip planning helper.

## What it does
- Builds a trip plan from templates (Field day / Hike / Travel day) + your custom items.
- Saves everything in `localStorage` so it persists between visits.
- Exports:
  - Copyable markdown plan
  - `plan.txt`
  - `plan.ics` calendar event (download)

No secrets, no server.

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in a browser.

## Deploy
Lives under `apps/field-kit-planner/` and is listed in `apps/manifest.json` so it shows up on the Philbin Apps page.
